      <h3 class="cajita">abstract</h3>

      <p>
        in March 2022 i joined the faculty of University of Chile, Chile's
        premier state university, where i teach both requisite and elective
        courses in the undergraduate school of design.
      </p>

      <p>
        "design of electronic interfaces", is an Arduino-based elective course
        that i created, wrote and taught my first semester at the University to
        more than 30 students with no programming or electronics experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        because of the success of this course, the next semester i was promoted
        to teach two further undergraduate courses: the compulsory "physics
        applied to designers", and another elective i created, "design of
        digital musical instruments", for a total of 120 students this year.

        these captures are some examples of student projects of "design of
        electronic interfaces."

      <p>
        and these are from the course "design of digital musical instruments,"
        where we programmed using Adafruit's Circuit Playground ecosystem, Pure
        Data, and ChucK.
