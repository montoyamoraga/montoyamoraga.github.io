        collaborated with Playa Fome in further mixing and publishing of the
        artist's output, including Ssshh, his second EP. these releases and

      <h3 class="cajita">recording and mixing process</h3>

      <p>
        the EP was recorded and mixed at the bandurria recording studio. here i
        house my instrument collection, that i play and research as a
        multi-instrumentalist, producer, and instrument maker, including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Critter And Guitari Pocket Piano synthesizer</li>
        <li>Fender Bass VI baritone guitar</li>
        <li>Moog Sustainer guitar</li>
        <li>Suzuki Omnichord synthesizer and drum machine</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        all instruments, except a few exceptions were recorded by Playa Fome,
        with my assistance for MIDI and drum machine programming
      </p>

      <h3 class="cajita">further releases</h3>

      <p>
        Playa Fome's second EP was written and recorded during the pandemic,
        while he was based in France and i was in the USA, so i only did the
        mixing of this record, and we are currently working on his third EP
      </p>
